# # Image Classification
# In this lab, you'll classify images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#get-the-data).  The dataset consists of different types of clothing items such as shirts, trousers, sneakers etc. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a model with convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
# ## Get the Data
# We have provided you with a pickle file for the dataset available in the GitHub repo. We have provided with a script - helper.py, which extracts the dataset for you when the corresponding functions are called.

# ## Explore the Data
# The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from the following 10 classes:
#
# * T-shirt/top
# * Trouser
# * Pullover
# * Dress
# * Coat
# * Sandal
# * Shirt
# * Sneaker
# * Bag
# * Ankle boot
#
# Understanding a dataset is part of making predictions on the data.  Play around with the code cell below by changing the `sample_id`. The `sample_id` is the id for a image and label pair in the dataset.
#
# Ask yourself "What are all possible labels?", "What is the range of values for the image data?", "Are the labels in order or random?".  Answers to questions like these will help you preprocess the data and end up with better predictions.

The one-hot encoding function should return the same encoding for each value between each call to `one_hot_encode`.  Make sure to save the map of encodings outside the function.

# For the neural network, you'll build each layer into a function.  Most of the code you've seen has been outside of functions. To test your code more thoroughly, we require that you put each layer in a function.  This allows us to give you better feedback and test for simple mistakes using our unittests.

#  * Name the TensorFlow placeholder "keep_prob" using the TensorFlow `name` parameter in the [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).
